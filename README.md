🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project that demonstrates the end-to-end data analysis process, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and interactive dashboard creation in Excel.

📊 Project Description
The objective of this project is to derive meaningful insights from the raw dataset by performing the following steps:

Data Cleaning (Cleaned_Data.xlsx)
The raw data was thoroughly cleaned to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure correct data types for accurate analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA.ipynb)
A Jupyter Notebook containing the entire EDA process, including:
Data summary and understanding
Univariate and bivariate analysis
Trend analysis, distributions, and correlations
Key insights identified for decision-making
Interactive Dashboard (Dashboard.xlsx)
An Excel dashboard was created using pivot tables, slicers, and charts to visually represent:
The major KPIs derived from the data
Dynamic filtering for deeper analysis
Clean and interactive design for stakeholders

🛠️ Tools Used
Excel – For data cleaning and dashboard creation
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – For data analysis and EDA
Jupyter Notebook – For documenting analysis process
📈 Outcome
This project enhances data-driven decision-making by providing stakeholders with:

Clean, reliable data for further modelling
Comprehensive insights into trends and patterns
An interactive dashboard to monitor KPIs efficiently
